            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
  <li>Having an external CSS file you have to link it to the original by link rel="stylesheet" href="</li>
  <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
  <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.
     DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
  <li>The "img" selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, 
    which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>

    <li>git add: add a file qw it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
    <li>git reset:unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory.</li>      
  <li>git diff:diff of what is stagged but not yet commited.</li>
<li>git commit -m: commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
<li>git push: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.</li>
<li> git pull: fetch and mrege any commits from tracking remote branch.</li>
<li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. 
  Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.
   In our example, we created two separate functions: one for our for loop and one for our if statement.</li>

            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the parentheses. 
              For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.</li>
            <li>Math.floor( ) and Math.random( ) are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
